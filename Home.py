    Welcome to the Road Damage Detection App ‚Äî an AI-powered tool that detects and classifies road surface damage using images, videos, or live webcam input.

    This app uses a YOLOv8 deep learning model trained on real-world road imagery from Japan and India to accurately detect four common types of road damage:

    - **Longitudinal Crack**
    - **Transverse Crack**
    - **Alligator Crack**
    - **Potholes**

    The model is optimized for fast and efficient detection, supporting various input modes to suit different needs ‚Äî whether you're analyzing a single image or inspecting roads in real time.
